# Virtual Scroll Access System


```
├─ build/          # Gradle build outputs
├─ bin/            # Runtime artifacts generated by the app
├─ data/           # Persistent storage (users.db, scroll uploads, etc.)
├─ src/
│  ├─ main/java/   # Application source
│  └─ test/java/   # Automated tests
├─ build.gradle    # Root build script
└─ settings.gradle
```

## Useful Commands

1. `gradle clean build` – wipes previous outputs and compiles everything from scratch.
2. `gradle test jacocoTestReport` – executes the full JUnit suite and regenerates JaCoCo coverage reports under `build/reports/jacoco/test`.
3. `gradle run` – launches the console application; ensure the terminal provides interactive stdin.

## Guidence for Sprint:
currently all the functional requirment has been completed, and the test coverage is about 84%.
I would suggest split the whole code into three parts
first sprint - user_management and relavent test case   you can find relevant code on that folder.
second sprint - digital_scroll_management and relavent test case
last sprint - scroll_seeker and relavent test case

the whole appliance combines terminal UI and GUI by javaswing, I think GUI is more convenient if someone
want to upload and download the file.

all the information from user is stored in data folder
the only admin account is username: admin, password: admin123

please make sure you know how to implment the code.

from my opnion, the focus of this assignment is scrum method, not coding, so I dont think
tutor will ask anything specifically about how you do it by writing code, tutor will only ask
how to implment the code, and check if the result is satisfying.

when you copy the code or split the work, please make sure you also copy the content of configuration files such as build.gradle and gradle.properties, also settings.gradle.
